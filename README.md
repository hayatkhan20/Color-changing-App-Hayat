# Description:
The Color Changing App is a simple and interactive web application designed to dynamically alter the background color of the entire page with each button click. Users can experience a visually stimulating and ever-changing display of colors by interacting with the "Change Color" button. Behind the scenes, the application utilizes JavaScript to generate a random hexadecimal color code whenever the button is clicked. The generated color is then applied to the background of the HTML body element, creating an instant and visually appealing transformation. The application showcases the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and responsive user experience.

The development of the Color Changing App involved writing clean and efficient code to achieve the desired functionality. In the pseudo code, the application starts by defining a function, `getRandomColor()`, which generates a random hexadecimal color code. This function is then linked to the button's click event using an event listener. When the button is clicked, the event triggers the `getRandomColor()` function, and the generated color is applied to the background of the HTML body element. The use of pseudo code in the development process allows developers to outline the logical flow and key steps without getting into the specifics of syntax, providing a high-level overview of the app's functionality before diving into actual code implementation. This approach enhances clarity and facilitates collaboration among developers during the development phase.
